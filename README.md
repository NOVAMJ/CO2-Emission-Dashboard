# 🌍 CO₂ Emission Dashboard: Historical Trends & Top Emitters

## 📌 1. Project Title / Headline
**CO₂ Emission Dashboard**  
An interactive and visually rich dashboard built to explore global CO₂ emissions over time, analyze top emitters, and identify trends for climate action planning. Designed with **Power BI** for analysts, researchers, and policy-makers.

---

## 🔍 2. Short Description / Purpose
The **CO₂ Emission Dashboard** is a comprehensive visualization tool that provides insights into historical and current CO₂ emissions across countries and continents.  
This dashboard helps users:
- Understand emission growth over time
- Compare top emitting countries
- Highlight areas for environmental action

---

## 🧰 3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:  
- 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization platform  
- 🛠 **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- 🔢 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For calculated measures, visuals, and analytics  
- 🗃 **Data Modeling** – Established relationships between emissions datasets  
- 📝 **File Formats** – `.pbix` for development, `.png` for dashboard preview  

---

## 🗂️ 4. Data Source
The data is sourced from:  
- 🌐 **Data In Our World** (Public datasets on global emissions)  
- Emission metrics from **1750 – 2020+**, covering **top 10 emitting countries** and global growth rates.

## 🎯 5. Features / Highlights

- **Business Problem**  
  Climate change mitigation requires a deep understanding of historical and geographical CO₂ emission trends. Raw data is complex and difficult to interpret.  

- **Goal of the Dashboard**  
  To present a **clear, actionable visualization tool** for analysts, researchers, and policymakers to track emission trends and support decision-making for sustainability.  

- **Walkthrough of Key Visuals**
  - 📈 **Global CO₂ Emission Over Time** – Highlights historical growth from 1750 onwards  
  - 🌍 **Geographical Map of Top Emitters** – Visualizes top emitting countries globally  
  - 📊 **Total Emission by Entity** – Bar chart ranking emissions per country  
  - 🔍 **Cumulative Emissions by Entity** – Historical comparison of top contributors  
  - 🎯 **Top 10 Entity Share** – Donut chart representing percentage share of emissions  
  - 🧩 **Key KPIs (Cards)** – Instant snapshot of total emissions, annual emissions, and top emitters
